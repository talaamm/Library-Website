Hello There!
here is Tala Amm, i liked to share with you my first ever project when i was in school yet (2019)
i started in the field of programming through web development (Html, Css, Js)

here i decided to make an Online Library where users are allowed to download books as pdf.
i decided to do this because we were in the very beggining of COVID-19

which talked about the Importance of Books, Books as Sources of Knowledge, Different Types of Books, Benefits of Reading:
